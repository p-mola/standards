# P!MOLA Standards SuperRepo

Here you can find the standards we will use for P!MOLA project.

## Player Features

Actual monolith of the standards project: Known player features.

With this project:

1) It will be easier to define some "exception" tasks and abstract it out of the project.

2) It should make maintaining said exception tasks as there will be little to no effort for removing said exceptions. Just changing a property from "unsupported" to "supported" or something like that.

3) If there are any developers searching for support data for some new feature, it will be basically ready. Whether it's for making a graph, a table, or a using as evidence to implement a feature or not; there will be some data, ready to boil, mash and stick'em in a stew.

In the future this project will mostly be updated with the app developers themselves, with a panel. For now, we will test and update our data.

While there is no set in stone guideline for this project, there is some _wishlist_ goals defined in our [Who are we!](https://github.com/p-mola/) page.

## Schemas

Contains YAML schemas for validation. This will be used in tests, for now.

Planned to use in [Player Features](#player-features) for automatic validating and automatic PR merging.

## Proposed Features

Mostly for discussion. We may add a feature as a future goal to here, using the very own discussion we had with you!
